# Popular Movies Stage 2
### For Udacity Android Nanodegree Project 2

Add your TMDB API key in the gradle.properties file. 

This project queries the TMDB database for popular movies and top rated movies.
It then displays them in a grid with more details when a movie is clicked on. 
A sql database saves all the content. There is also a favorites database implemented. 

* Upon launch, present the user with an grid arrangement of movie posters.
* Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
    * The sort order can be by most popular, or by top rated
* Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information.
* You’ll allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
* You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
* You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). This is for a local movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request*.
